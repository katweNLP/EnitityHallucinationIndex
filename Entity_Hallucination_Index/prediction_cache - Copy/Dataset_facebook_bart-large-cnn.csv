"Seven photographs taken in the Norfolk countryside by photographer Josh Olins will appear in the June edition. In her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes. The shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition. The duchess, who has a keen interest in photography, has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery since 2012. Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: ""Josh has captured the duchess exactly as she is - full of life, with a great sense of humour, thoughtful and intelligent, and in fact, very beautiful."" He said the images also encapsulated what Vogue had done over the past 100 years - ""to pair the best photographers with the great personalities of the day, in order to reflect broader shifts in culture and society"".

"Chris Poole - known as ""moot"" online - created the site in 2003. It has gone on to be closely associated with offensive and often illegal activity, including instances where the images of child abuse were shared. It was widely credited as being the first place where leaked images of nude celebrities were posted following 2014's well-publicised security breach affecting Apple's iCloud service. That incident prompted a policy change on the site. However, 4chan has also been the rallying point for many instances of online activism from the likes of Anonymous, the loosely organized hacktivism group.

"Barca will be investigated for alleged misappropriation of funds in the £48.6m (57m euros) deal with Santos.

Vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu now takes over from the 49-year-old Rosell, who came to power in 2010. Rosell's future has been a real source of concern ever since a Spanish national court judge accepted a lawsuit this week from Barcelona club member Jordi Cases, who alleged that the amount paid for Neymar was more than the reported fee. Rosell maintains the accusation is ""unfair and reckless"". He added: ""For some time, my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence. These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardise my family. ""From the beginning, I have said the signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries."" Rosell said he was resigning to spare the club's board of directors from ""unfair attacks"" that could ""negatively affect their management or the image of the club"". He added: ""It has been an honour to serve the Barcelonistas. It's been a privilege to be the president of FC Barcelona.""

"The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead. The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000. The government said London was the highest funded part of the country. It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average. But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance. Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200. It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures. In a statement, London Councils said: ""At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country."" It added: ""Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy. Over 60% of jobs in inner London require a degree and around 45% of jobs in the rest of the capital require a degree.""","About 70% of London schools could face budget cuts under government plans to change how they are funded, according to London Councils.","Think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead.

"His 110 means he has scored 323 runs in a week after an unbeaten 93 against Glamorgan in the One-Day Cup and 120 not out against Kent in the T20 Blast.

Roy's century was a fine retort against Division One leaders Middlesex, who dismissed the England limited-overs opener for a first-ball duck in the One-Day Cup on Tuesday. After paceman Murtagh removed both Zafar Ansari and Dominic Sibley early on, Surrey's slump continued as James Franklin trapped Aaron Finch (37) to leave them 70-3. Burns helped turn their fortunes around as he hit 15 fours in his 127-ball knock as the visitors seized the initiative.

"Ms Kendall told the BBC Labour risked sending a ""resignation letter to the British people as a serious party of government"" by electing Mr Corbyn. Separately, Ms Cooper warned there was a ""serious risk the party will split"" if the left-winger becomes its leader. It comes as Labour begins sending out the first ballot papers to voters. The result of the contest will be announced at a special conference on 12 September. More than 600,000 people have signed up to vote in the four-way contest but Labour has said applications are still being verified. 610,753 total electorate, though this may fall as party removes those not entitled to vote Of which, full party members:  299,755 Affiliated to a trade union:  189,703 Registered to vote by paying Â£3:  121,295 Meanwhile voting in the election for the new Scottish Labour leader ended at midday. Mr Corbyn is due to unveil a 10-point policy plan while in Glasgow later. The popularity of the left-wing Islington North MP, who is promising ""a new kind of politics"", has sparked a row about the future direction of the Labour party. Another leadership contender, Andy Burnham, told the BBC Mr Corbyn's policies ""lack credibility"". ""It's not possible to promise free university education, re-nationalising the utilities, without that coming at a great cost and if you can't explain how that is going to be paid for then I don't think we'll win back the trust of voters on the economy,"" he said. BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there had been ""frustration"" in rival camps who accused Mr Burnham of being reluctant to take on Mr Corbyn. This appeared to be his most direct attack yet, he added. But in an interview with Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2, Mr Burnham declined to follow Ms Kendall and Ms Cooper and advise his supporters not to back Mr Corbyn with their second and third preferences. He added: ""People will say if they hear things like that, 'hang on, what do you believe?'"" In an interview with The Independent, Ms Kendall called for voters to mark Ms Cooper or Mr Burnham as second and third preferences, and avoid giving votes to Mr Corbyn. ""I have set out very clearly where I differ with all the candidates but our differences with Jeremy's kind of politics are far greater,"" said Ms Kendall. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said she ""can't pretend to be agnostic"" about a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying of the voting process: ""It is an alternative vote system and I want to urge party members to use all of their different preferences. ""I will be using my second and third preferences and I would urge others to do the same because I don't want to see our party go back to the politics of the '80s, just being a party of protest."" The Leicester West MP also said she did not see the party splitting, as it did in the 1980s when Labour members formed the Social Democratic Party. However, Ms Cooper told BBC 2's Newsnight: ""I think there is a serious risk that the party will split, will polarise and I cannot bear to see that happen because there is too much at stake."" Asked in an interview with grassroots Labour website Labourlist whether voters should use their votes to try to prevent Mr Corbyn winning, she said: ""I think people should use all of their preferences. ""And I think the focus has to be how do we make sure we can win that election, and that's the most important thing - and I don't think Jeremy can do that."" Mr Corbyn has warned against ""personal abuse"" in the campaign, saying he wants to focus on policy. His policy programme includes a commitment to ""growth not austerity"", nationalising the railways and energy sector, and a plan for nuclear disarmament. In an essay for the Fabian Society he also suggested Labour's new increased following should be more involved in the party and proposed a review of membership fees to make the party more ""inclusive"". Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to join the debate over the leadership contest with a speech on Sunday, called ""power for a purpose - the future of the Labour Party"". Lance Price, former director of communications for Labour, told the BBC the contest had been an ""unedifying mess"" and had ""done nothing to reengage the labour party with those millions of people who deserted it"". The Guardian newspaper has endorsed Ms Cooper for the leadership while the Daily Mirror has given its backing to Mr Burnham, although the paper urged him to ""find a role"" in his team for Mr Corbyn, who it says has ""lit up the election campaign"".",Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have said their supporters should back anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn in the contest.,"More than 600,000 people have signed up to vote in the four-way contest.

"The Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020. The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead. Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham. She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue. It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years. Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets. ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much. The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget. Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools. One respondent said his school was moving to a ""bare bones education"", in which ""the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away"". Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support. More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education. And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips. Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects. Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level. Another said: ""Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!"" One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to ""creak"" with all staff working to full capacity. Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: ""School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need. ""Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people."" A spokesman for the DfE said: ""As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential. ""The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019-20.""","Head teachers say they are axing GCSE and A-level subjects, increasing class sizes and cutting support services as they struggle with school funding.","Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances.

"Ann Barnes dealt with an ""ill-advised"" TV documentary, a probe into her car insurance, and youth commissioners who both had to step away from their role. But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success. She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work.

Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: ""You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it."" Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports. ""[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does.

On her youth commissioner appointments, Mrs Barnes said: ""You can't interview for the unexpected.""

Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract. After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced. Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's ""open and transparent"" culture.

"Taylor, 25, joined County in May from Macclesfield, but has yet to start in the league. The move has left Newport with only one goalkeeper in Joe Day, but manager John Sheridan is confident he will quickly fill the vacancy.

"The Derbyshire club, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One North, have lost all 19 league and cup games this season. New Mills have conceded 68 goals while three managers have left since June. ""It's tough but we've got a new squad and the players are starting to gel,"" Millers boss Garry Brown told BBC Radio 5 live's Non League Football Show. Former Norwich City midfielder Keith Briggs took over from Roy Soule, who stepped down in June, but resigned after just 23 days for a job with Sheffield United's academy. Andy Fearn was put in charge in July and appointed former Manchester City striker Shaun Goater as his assistant. But Fearn and Goater lasted just nine league and cup games before resigning after a 7-1 home defeat to Prescot Cables. Brown, who has overseen 10 league and cup defeats, added: ""There's been a lot of changes to the squad and there's only three players still here from when we took over in September. ""There's no budget, it's petrol money these lads are playing for."" All is not lost for the Millers, who are bottom of the table, 10 points behind Harrogate Railway Athletic, the next team above them.

"The referendum will take place on 10 March, but Bath Conservative MP Ben Howlett said he was concerned about a ""lack of awareness"" about the issue. Mr Howlett also said he is worried about the public's level of engagement. Bath and North East Somerset Council said the referendum had been publicised in press releases and tweets. It also said it was the subject of a two-page article in the winter edition of the council magazine which was distributed to all households in the region. A further news release and polling cards will also be sent out to all households this week, the authority added. Supporters of the referendum say Bath needs a mayor to give local government more visibility. Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum. Mr Howlett said he was ""personally concerned"" that an elected mayor was not appropriate for an area ""as diverse"" as Bath and North East Somerset, and that it could ""lead to an increase in the cost of local politics"". ""The level of misinformation on this issue is worrying - many people seem to still believe this is about a mayor of Bath and not understanding it would cover all of Bath and North East Somerset.

"More than a dozen men stormed into the Kiwi cafe in the Georgian capital on Sunday evening, the cafe said, shouting and throwing meat at patrons. A brawl erupted but the attackers fled before police arrived. Police are now investigating, and say they have questioned the attackers and cafe staff. Nobody has been arrested. The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis. The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi. They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute. The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings. Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West. The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of ""the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat"" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. ""During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!"" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook. It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying ""to defend those fascists"". It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents. The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia. Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say. The country made world headlines in 2013 when a small group of LGBT activists were attacked by a large mob led by an orthodox priest. The cafe statement blames Sunday's incident on the group of men who came into the premises, talking loudly, throwing meat and smoking, and then ""yelling, laughing, and talking to us sarcastically"". These people ""were neo-Nazis... who support fascist ideas"", the cafe said. Some minor injuries were sustained. The police arrived only after the attackers had left, but the cafe said even some of those officers behaved aggressively, ""yelled with anger, said that we are guilty of what had happened"".",A vegan cafe in Tbilisi has appealed for public solidarity after being invaded by ultra-nationalists wielding grilled meat and sausages.,"More than a dozen men stormed into the Kiwi cafe in the Georgian capital.

"The New Zealander made only one unenforced switch, bringing in Rhys Webb for Gareth Davies at scrum-half. Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Alex Cuthbert miss out with injuries. ""We wanted to give the players a chance to sort of put behind us a disappointing first half from last week,"" said Gatland. Flanker Justin Tipuric, second row Luke Charteris and Hallam Amos are drafted in to the team in place of the injured players. Dan Lydiate will captain the side in the absence of Warburton and regular stand-in Jones. Gatland said he had shown faith in players who had performed well in earlier matches, a fact he acknowledged was hard on hooker Ken Owens who makes his fourth appearance on the bench in this Six Nations championship.

""Ken has been brilliant for us coming off the bench and I know that's a tag he doesn't want to keep, but he is unlucky not to get a start."" Scarlets hooker Owens had made 38 appearances for Wales, but started in only eight of those games.

He said it was a ""personal honour for me and my family"" and added his captaincy style was unsophisticated. ""I wouldn't ask someone to do something that I wouldn't do myself, so I'll throw myself in front of a bus so that's what I expect everyone else to do,"" he said.

"Then playing for Walsall, the 24-year-old won his first senior cap for Wales in their defeat by Ukraine in March, giving him the chance to rub shoulders with the duo. Injury dashed his hopes of joining them at Euro 2016, however. ""They constantly want to improve and get better so that's something every footballer should apply to their game,"" Bradshaw told BBC Radio Wales. Media playback is not supported on this device Wales have been buoyed by the success of Arsenal midfielder Ramsey and Real Madrid forward Bale in 2016 as they reached the semi-finals of the European Championships, their first international tournament for 58 years. Bradshaw, who has scored three goals in 19 appearances for the Tykes this season, puts the success of the pair down to two factors. ""You watch them train and you watch them play and you try to pick their brains about how they managed to get to that level,"" he said. ""A lot of it is natural ability and natural talent, but the thing that strikes me is their hunger; their hunger to want to improve even though Gareth's playing for Real Madrid and he's a massive part of his country's team."" Bradshaw says he was ""gutted"" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention. The former Aberystwyth Town player has since concentrated on boosting his future Wales hopes by performing well for his new club Barnsley. ""It was incredibly frustrating, with hindsight as well, at how well the lads did,"" he said. ""I was incredibly proud of the boys and how impressive they were at the Euros. I was gutted, but that's football. Unfortunately that was part and parcel of the game. ""But I picked my head up and managed to get a move to the Championship and I'm just trying to improve. It hurt for a while. It took for the majority of that summer for me to get over it. ""I was watching all the games and cheering the lads on from afar, but it was invaluable experience for me to go away to Portugal although I didn't manage to train that much because of the injury, it's all experience that I've enjoyed and hopefully I can put it into good use in the future and hopefully one day I'll get an opportunity again.""",Barnsley striker Tom Bradshaw says every footballer can learn from the examples set by Wales stars Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.,"Wales reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016, their first tournament in 58 years.

"John MacIntosh, 46, of Dingwall, must serve at least 10 years in prison after being convicted by a jury of four serious sexual offences. At the High Court in Aberdeen, judge Lord Uist said MacIntosh was a ""sexual fiend"" who targeted vulnerable females. MacIntosh had previously been jailed for seven years for having sex with 13 and 14-year-old girls. The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004. He sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the young girl and raped three women. In his sentencing statement, Lord Uist said: ""You targeted vulnerable females in order to gratify your carnal lust. ""You have called all these women liars and shown no remorse for what you did."" The judge added: ""It is clear to me that you have no respect for women and are a sexual fiend."" Lord Uist said MacIntosh should not assume that he would be automatically released after having served 10 years in prison. He said: ""You will be released only when the Parole Board for Scotland is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you continue to be held in prison."" Police Scotland has welcomed the life sentence. Det Insp Eddie Ross said the case was brought to the attention of police by the NHS.

"A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire. Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack. A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack. Islamic State militants also operate in the area. Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan. The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand. It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May. Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province. In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched. It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police. Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike. In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure. The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations. Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops. Afghanistan has been hit by numerous violent attacks in recent weeks with the launch of the Taliban's spring offensive, including a massive bomb attack in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 150 people.","Three US special forces soldiers have been shot dead by an Afghan colleague during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, US officials say.",Afghan commando opened fire on US troops during joint operation in Achin.

"Cathay is one of the world's biggest cargo airlines, and its decision is expected to have a sizeable impact. Previously, the airline had said it would only transport shark fin that was sustainably sourced. Shark fin is considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine and is often served as a soup at upmarket banquets. More than 70 million sharks are killed every year, according to WWF figures. Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China. ""On the issue of shark's fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday. It said it had not approved any shark fin shipments over the last year, pointing out that it had turned down 15 shipment requests for shark-related products. Early reports said the ban extended to all shark products on cargo and passenger flights, but the airline told the BBC it currently applied to shark fin only, Cathay said it would continue to review its policy. Marine conservationists hailed Cathay's decision, with one proclaiming that it would make Hong Kong ""proud"". ""More Hong Kong businesses need to follow the lead,"" Hong Kong-based conservationist Sharon Kwok told AFP. Government data cited by the South China Morning Post shows that shark fin imports to Hong Kong dropped by 42% between 2010 and 2015 to 5,717 tonnes.

"The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project. The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering. The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle. The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link. ""Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,"" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark. Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations. These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts. Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests. The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area. Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.",Archaeologists in Denmark have uncovered an incredibly rare find: a stone age axe held within its wooden handle.,"5,500-year-old axe was found in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland.

"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone. But last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood. Forestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting. You can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist. Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree. That's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens. The last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago. So Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees. Not all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk. The idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds. Well this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature. Robert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see. It's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year. Can we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference? Well yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree. Those branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden. It's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers. The trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future. Meaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees. The only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch. Fingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!",Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting.,"Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.

"The hyperbaric chamber, which treats divers with ""the bends"", was operated by St John's Ambulance on a donation basis until it broke in April 2014. The health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to ""balance the books"". Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was ""gobsmacked"". ""I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,"" he said. ""We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured."" In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system. Source: NHS Assistant director at Guernsey's health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year. He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on ""the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years"". In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said. Commercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC. It is a legal requirement to provide a hyperbaric chamber facility for commercial diving activity to take place within Guernsey's 12-mile limit.","Divers in Guernsey will be hit with a £30,000 charge if they require treatment for decompression sickness, the government has confirmed.","The hyperbaric chamber was operated by St John's Ambulance on a donation basis until it broke in April 2014.

"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. ""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months. Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say.","The UN says an estimated 50,000 people have been displaced in the city of Hassakeh.

"The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period. The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%. However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%. The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%. ""The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services. Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes. Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June. Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter. Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter. Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year. The International Monetary Fund this week cut its forecast for US economic growth, in part citing uncertainty over the chances for tax reform and infrastructure spending, policies that many say could provide an economic boost.",The US economy grew at a faster pace than previously thought in the first three months of the year.,"The US economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period.

"Class-A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were among the illegal substances seized, according to the data from police in England and Wales. There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures from 34 police forces. Teachers described the statistics as a ""worry"" and the ""tip of the iceberg"". The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act. PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014. The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from. Just over three-quarters of forces replied. Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved. The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27. Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy. Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire. Only four incidents involved children under 11. An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug. There were 241 incidents involving 15- to 16-year-olds and 231 incidents involving 11- to 14-year-olds. In Greater Manchester, a 14-year-old was caught with heroin with a street value of £500, and a 16-year-old with a quantity worth £330. Other incidents involved parents or school employees, including a school gardener in Humberside and a cleaner at a Manchester primary. The highest number of incidents and offences in the three complete years to March 2014 was for Hampshire with 229 cases. There were 144 incidents in Avon and Somerset and 138 in the West Midlands. South Wales police reported 92 cases. There was a slight year-on-year decrease in the numbers which peaked at 657 in 2011-12 and fell to 611 and 560 in the next two years, while in the period March to December 2014, there were 407 incidents. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said any incident of drugs on school premises was ""worrying as it will often only be the tip of the iceberg of what young people are encountering on the streets. ""Teachers and school leaders are always alert to the potential for young people being involved in drug or alcohol abuse."" Ms Keates said many specialist programmes to help schools support and educate young people about substance abuse had been cut in recent years.","Hundreds of schoolchildren, among them a pupil of only eight, have been caught with drugs on school premises, new figures reveal.","There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures.

On Wednesday, Belfast Magistrates' Court was told that a hearing to decide if the suspected UVF commander-turned police informer has a case to answer is scheduled for November. Mr Haggarty has been waiting to discover if he will stand trial since signing an agreement to become an assisting offender under the terms of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) back in 2010. The north Belfast man was charged with 212 charges covering a 16-year period between 1991 and 2007.

"Michael Bryn Jones, 39, from Llandudno, disappeared on 3 April 2016 after going to the door of the Hergest psychiatric unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor. He was found hanging in woodland on 21 June. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it has already changed its procedures. An inquest into Mr Jones' death heard he had been a patient at the Hergest unit until a few days before his disappearance and continued to suffer anxiety and paranoia after he left hospital. He turned up at the unit in the early hours of 3 April and was sent to the accident and emergency department but left without booking in or speaking to anyone. Robat Hughes, the senior nurse who spoke to Mr Jones at the unit, told the inquest he regretted not asking him whether he was already having treatment. ""He came to the door and asked to see a doctor, but I said there was no doctor there as she'd gone home sick.  I said that if he went to accident and emergency then there were doctors there,"" he said. ""He was relaxed and calm.  I didn't know if he was using mental health services and I didn't ask. ""I should have asked if he'd been having treatment.  It has been something I've thought about a lot since.""

"Wholesale prices have dropped and motoring organisations have suggested this merits reduced pump prices. Tesco and Morrisons are cutting prices by 2p a litre on Friday, and Asda and Sainsbury's said they would reduce prices by up to 2p a litre on Saturday. But drivers are being warned that prices can vary in different areas. The average UK price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 118.83p on Thursday, and 120.88p for a litre of diesel, according to the latest figures from Experian Catalist. Ten days earlier, the average unleaded price was 120p a litre, and diesel cost 122.06p. The oil price and wholesale prices fell sharply at the start of March, and motoring organisations have argued that this should have been feeding through to another 2p cut per litre in prices at the pumps. The RAC said motorists could feel ""aggrieved"" that prices had not fallen further, earlier. Asda said it had dropped prices twice in two weeks, and had a national price cap to ensure motorists were dealt with equitably. Morrisons said it had also made a second cut in two weeks. Tesco is dropping petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre over the course of Friday afternoon at all its outlets, followed by Sainsbury's on Saturday. Luke Bosdet, of the AA, said that there was general concern that so-called supermarket fuel price wars did not actually benefit all drivers across the country. He claimed prices fell the most in areas where there were a range of supermarkets located close to each other. In other areas with less competition, the same cuts were not as likely to be seen.

"More than 5,500 people signed a petition against plans to build a five-metre embankment along the waterfront.

A report to a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway Council's environment committee next week will attempt to find a way forward. What's happening in Scotland? Keep in touch through our live page. Chairman Colin Smyth said: ""What we are now able to do is focus on what I think is the biggest issue as far as the public is concerned. In the draft proposal, the height of the embankment and the walls were simply too high and the public did not support that. ""What we now need to do is make sure that we find a solution that deals with the flooding, regenerates the Whitesands, solves the car parking issues, but also reduces the height of any proposed flood protection scheme."" Water from the River Nith regularly spills over into the Whitesands, flooding a major town centre car park and nearby business premises. Campaigners against the Â£15m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots. They also raised concerns that the move would lead to the loss of about 200 waterfront car parking spaces. David Slater, a local businessman who has been one of the project's most vocal objectors, said: ""However many other consultations they do now, public opinion will not change at this stage.

"The towns of Virginia Water and Cobham, in Surrey, have become Britain's first million pound towns - where average house prices are more than £1m. Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank. They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures. The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015. Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital. No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000. Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m. And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m. ""We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million,"" said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank. ""Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first."" However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m. In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall. One reason for that is the change in Stamp Duty rates, introduced in December 2014.

"They describe it as a kind of ""jet stream"" - a fast-flowing river of liquid iron that is surging westwards under Alaska and Siberia. The moving mass of metal has been inferred from measurements made by Europe’s Swarm satellites. This trio of spacecraft are currently mapping Earth's magnetic field to try to understand its fundamental workings. The scientists say the jet is the best explanation for the patches of concentrated field strength that the satellites observe in the northern hemisphere. ""This jet of liquid iron is moving at about fifty kilometres per year,"" explained Dr Chris Finlay from the National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Space). “That might not sound like a lot to you on Earth's surface, but you have to remember this a very dense liquid metal and it takes a huge amount of energy to move this thing around and that's probably the fastest motion we have anywhere within the solid Earth,” he told BBC News. Dr Finlay was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, just ahead of the official publication of the research in the journal Nature Geoscience. Most people will be familiar with the atmospheric jet stream - the high-altitude, rapidly flowing belt of air on which aeroplanes ride to get to their destination more quickly. Dr Finlay and colleagues want us to envision something similar but made of metal and 3,000km down, under our feet. They assess the jet to be about 420km wide, and say it wraps half-way around the planet. Its behaviour will be critical to the generation and maintenance of the global magnetic field, they add. “It's likely that the jet stream has been in play for hundreds of millions of years,"" said Dr Phil Livermore from Leeds University, UK, and the lead author on the journal paper. In the paper, the team puts forward a model to explain the jet. The scientists say the feature probably aligns to a boundary between two different regions in the core. They call this boundary the ""tangent cylinder"". They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth’s rotation axis. When liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube. ""Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,"" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper. ""This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core."" Although the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain. Dr Livermore told BBC News: ""It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder)."" That the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation. Launched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth's magnetic field. With their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field's various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents. It is  hoped the Swarm satellites’ data could ultimately tell us why Earth’s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries. Scientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North. This occurs every few hundred thousand years.

"A application has been submitted to extend the Advanced Manufacturing and Research Centre Campus (AMRC) on the site of the old Sheffield Airport. The centre is already home to a number of high technology companies, including a £110m Rolls Royce jet engine factory. If approved, the new site would be developed over the next 10 years. Located on the Rotherham and Sheffield border, the site closed to commercial flying in 2008, although it is still the base for South Yorkshire Police's helicopter. The business park, which is home to a training centre and a nuclear research facility, opened in 2012. A new £43m ""flexible factory"" is being built in a partnership between the University of Sheffield and companies including Boeing. As well as new research facilities, offices and workspaces would be also be built. James Newman, chairman of the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership, said he hoped the expansion would encourage more businesses to invest in the area.

"The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, committed the offence while on a community payback order he received for having sex with a 12-year-old girl when he was 14. A court heard that he had sex with the 13-year-old in the grounds of Dundee and Angus College. The meeting was arranged on Snapchat. Dundee Sheriff Court heard how the pair had met through mutual friends in 2015 but there was no contact between them until June 2016 when he added her on the social networking app. Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said that when they met they chatted for some time and the accused was immediately affectionate towards the girl, kissing and cuddling her. ""He told her he had been 'choking to go with her' and they then walked towards the college,"" Ms Robertson said. ""He repeatedly asked her if she would have sex with him, and when in the grounds of the college he said 'have sex with me there' and pointed to a grassy area. ""They went there and had sex, after which he stood up and said he had to leave."" The girl's mother picked her up before the 13-year-old told her what had happened the next day. She then told a counsellor who called in police. The teenager was given a community payback order last year for his previous sex offence conviction. Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told him that custody was the only option this time because he did not appear to have learned from his previous community sentence. The 17-year-old pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act. Defence solicitor Katrina Clark urged the court to impose a second community payback order instead of a jail term. She said: ""He's aware he faces more time in custody. ""The more effective way forward for him would be through the intensive project outlined for him in the social work reports. That wouldn't be an easy option. ""This could be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence due to his age, the period he has spent in custody on remand and his acceptance of his guilt at an early stage."" Sheriff Alastair Carmichael imposed a one-year sentence of detention on the teenager, placed him on the sex offenders register for 10 years and imposed a sexual offences prevention order for six years during which time he will be monitored by specialist police officers. He said: ""Unfortunately from your perspective no other method than custody is appropriate. ""I've come to that decision based on the gravity of the offence and also because you were subject to a CPO with specialist elements which you don't appear to have learned from.""",A convicted teenage sex offender has been detained for a year for having sex with a 13-year-old girl in the grounds of a Dundee college campus.,"The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, committed the offence while on a community payback order he received for having sex with a 12-year old girl when he was 14.

"The two firms should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, according to a House Intelligence Committee report. The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military. Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September. On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat. ""ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,"" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying. How China became the US election bogeyman Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were ""dangerous political distractions"". ""Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security."" While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies. ""China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,"" the report says. ""Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems."" The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement. Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations. ""We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,"" Mr Rogers said on Monday. On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS. ""If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,"" he said. Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming ""more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations"". China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to ""set aside prejudices"" regarding the two firms. ""Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,"" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. ""Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations."" Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987. As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced. There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied. Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel. Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China. Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September. ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal. This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic. Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms. Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon. It was the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years. The Chinese firm has since sued Mr Obama, alleging the US government overstepped its authority.","Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE pose a security threat to the US, a congressional panel has warned after an investigation into the two companies.","Huawei and ZTE should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, report says.

"The decision drops the German to third place, behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen and cuts his points lead over Hamilton to one. Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem. They broke a rule saying: ""The driver must drive the car alone and unaided."" Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision. The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track. Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a ""critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal"". Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem. But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear. Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: ""Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear."" Rosberg then asked: ""What does that mean, I have to shift through it? Engineer: ""Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it."" Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance. Horner said: ""The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules. ""The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running. ""It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing. ""The question going forward is are these rules right for F1? That's a different question."" Wolff, speaking before the decision to penalise Mercedes, drew parallels between this situation and one in last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, when Force India did not tell their driver Sergio Perez that he had a critical brake problem and the Mexican crashed out on the final lap. Wolff said: ""We see that those rules maybe need a re-think between the FIA and the teams to maybe go more into detail on what is allowed or not because not communicating at all, you might as well unplug the radio and throw it out of the car. It is part of driving since a long time."" However, the rule is a pet project of FIA president Jean Todt and he has so far been deaf to questions about its suitability.

""He was making funny breathing noises, like heavy breathing. Shauneen said he was sleeping. He was like bruised with yellow bruising. There was foam coming out of his mouth,"" she said.

"Baroness Morgan said Labour is in a serious situation if it cannot reconnect with working class communities. She said there ""probably was an element"" of Labour's Remain campaign starting too late. ""A lot of us were exhausted"", she told BBC Radio Wales. Senior Welsh Labour sources have privately said they were wary of talking about Brexit before the assembly election in case it drove Eurosceptic supporters towards UKIP. Plaid leader no longer ruling out coalition with Labour AMs to have say on Brexit deal, says Welsh Tory leader Corbyn's Labour set for heavy losses, says Stephen Kinnock Asked if Labour's Remain campaign started too late, she told the Eye on Wales programme: ""I think there probably was an element of that. ""And don't forget in Wales we had the assembly elections where people were not talking about the European Union. We were focused absolutely on those assembly elections."" She added: ""I think it was a mistake not to be talking about the European referendum in those assembly elections."" Wales voted 52.5% to 47.5% for Brexit. Only five counting areas voted to Remain. The strongest Leave votes were in Torfaen (60%) and Blaenau Gwent (62%) - two traditional Labour strongholds in the south Wales valleys. The Welsh government has a programme to ""re-energise"" communities that voted to Leave, much of which would have been funded by EU money, Baroness Morgan said. ""The question for us now is how on Earth do we reorganise the economy without that European funding?"" she asked. ""Unless we find a way to reconnect with that working class element within our communities then I think the Labour party is in a serious situation in future"". Labour won 29 seats at May's assembly election - a better result than many expected - but lost 7.6% of its share of the vote on the constituency ballot.

"The 2015 winner has raced just twice since that victory and missed the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day.

"Mr Duterte clarified that he had ""nothing against gays"", saying several of his relatives were homosexual. The controversial politician had previously appeared supportive of LGBTQ rights, saying in 2015 that same-sex marriage was ""good"". But he is otherwise known for his conservative views especially on crime. He has waged a much-criticised war on drug users and dealers leading to thousands of extra-judicial killings. His latest remarks were made on Sunday night to Filipino expatriates in the Burmese capital of Nay Pyi Taw while on an official trip to Myanmar. A transcript of the speech was only given to journalists on Monday. In a meandering speech addressing criticism of his now-suspended war on drugs, Mr Duterte accused the West of imposing its values on the Philippines, then referred to a recent Time magazine story on the transgender community in the US. ""There is no gender because you can be a he or she... That's their culture. It does not apply to us. We are Catholics and there is the Civil Code, which says that you can only marry a woman for me... a woman to marry a man. ""That's our law so why would you accept that gender?"" he said. ""Wherever God placed you, just remain there. Do not mix it upâ€¦ You erase the great divide between a woman and a man,"" he added. Before becoming president in June 2016, Mr Duterte was the mayor of Davao city, which introduced anti-discrimination laws for sex, gender and sexual orientation during his administration. In 2015, Mr Duterte appeared on a national talk show where he said same-sex marriage was ""good... everyone deserves to be happy"". The following year, while campaigning for the presidency, he said he would ""consider"" legalising same-sex marriage if there was such a proposal. The Philippines has 80 million Catholics and remains a deeply religious society. Mr Duterte has taken issue with the church previously, once calling the Pope a ""son of a whore"". Despite his many controversial comments he still remains highly popular in the Philippines.","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said he opposes gay marriage, after previously declaring he would consider legalising it.","President Rodrigo Duterte made the remarks to Filipino expatriates in Myanmar.

"Deaf and blind people face a situation that is ""still grim"", according to charities Action on Hearing Loss Cymru, RNIB Cymru and Sense Cymru. New standards were introduced by the Welsh government over a year ago aimed at ensuring equal access to healthcare. But the report says little progress has been made. Richard Williams, director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said the charities that authored the report are ""really concerned"" that people are leaving surgeries and hospitals unclear about what doctors have told them, what medication they need or whether operations have been successful. New standards were brought in after a BBC Wales investigation in 2013 found health boards were breaching equality laws by not providing accessible services for the deaf and hard of hearing. But 91 per cent of people surveyed for the report said they were not aware of improvements in the way healthcare providers communicate and share information with them. Kay Coleman from Swansea began losing her hearing 15 years ago and said she finds it ""incredibly difficult"" to book a doctor's appointment. An estimated 500,000 people are affected by hearing loss and 100,000 are living with sight loss in Wales.

"The 48-year-old man suffered a suspected heart attack five minutes into the second half of Kilmarnock's home match against Hibernian. Paramedics and medical staff from both clubs treated the man until an ambulance arrived at Rugby Park stadium and he was taken to a nearby hospital. Both managers agreed to abandon the match out of respect for the fan. The stadium was hushed into silence when medical staff and club doctors attended the stricken fan in the west stand. The referee then stopped the match with the teams drawing 1-1. Players left the pitch as the gravity of the situation became evident. Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston said: ""The length of time the players were off the park was a problem but the overriding factor was respect for the fan and his family. ""He collapsed and was tended to by medical staff of both clubs and was taken to Crosshouse Hospital by ambulance."" He added that he could not reveal any more information about the fan's identity other than to say he was a long-standing season-ticket holder Later, a Police Scotland spokesman said the man died in hospital. Kilmarnock manager Kenny Shiels pointed out that it was the third time he had been present at such an incident while manager at the Rugby Park side.

"Pensions currently rise by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%. There have been warnings over the cost of the lock, and the government says it will review it after 2020. Shadow Treasury minister Rebecca Long-Bailey said this caused ""uncertainty and worry"", pledging to protect it ""throughout the lifetime of the next Parliament"", due to end in 2025. Speaking during Treasury questions in the Commons, Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was responsible for the government to decide which commitments it can afford to keep at a spending review before the end of Parliament. Attacking Labour's pledge, he added: ""I think it tells us everything we need to know about the Opposition - that three-and-a-half years out they're willing to spray around commitments without any idea of what it's going to cost them."" During last week's Autumn Statement Mr Hammond said the triple lock would be maintained until 2020 but suggested it would then be reviewed. There have been calls for it to be scrapped, including from former pensions minister Baroness Altmann, who said the costs would become ""enormous"" after 2020, and the previous work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb.

"The decree, or fatwa, was passed on Sunday by a group of clerics. It said that according to Islam transgender people with ""visible signs"" of being male or female may marry someone of the opposite sex. But those with ""visible signs of both genders"" may not marry, it said. The 50 clerics, part of the little-known Tanzeem Ittehad-i-Ummat body based in Lahore, also said any act intended to ""humiliate, insult or tease"" transgender individuals should be considered a crime under Islam. The fatwa is not legally binding in any way. ""We are glad that somebody's talked about us too,"" transgender rights worker Almas Bobby told BBC Urdu. ""By Sharia we already had the right [to marry], but unless measures are taken to remove the misconceptions about us in society, the condition of our community will not be changed."" Another social worker for gender issues told BBC Urdu that it was a ""good step"", but that issues would remain until transgender marriage was officially legitimised. Qamar Nasim said that many police officers had charged people in transgender marriages because ""due to a lack of knowledge... they consider it same-sex marriage"". ""This practice can only be stopped when [the] government spread awareness about rights of a transgender person."" Transgender people are discriminated against in Pakistan and struggle to find employment. More than 45 transgender people have been killed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the past two years, according to local rights group Trans Action. Last month, a 23-year-old transgender activist died after delays in treatment. Alisha, who was shot eight times, was in critical condition when admitted to hospital but staff could not decide whether to put her in a male or female ward, according to her friends. Trans Action, an advocacy group, say that there are at least 45,000 transgender people in the province and at least half-a-million nationwide. In 2012, Pakistan's Supreme Court declared equal rights for transgender citizens, including the right to inherit property and assets. They were also given the right to vote the year before. However, it has denied homosexual couples the permission to marry, with cases in the past of male homosexuals being charged under anti-sodomy laws.","A religious decree declaring transgender marriage to be legal has been cautiously welcomed in Pakistan, but activists say attitudes still need to change.","Transgender people with ""visible signs"" of being male or female may marry someone of the opposite sex.

"The company said PCs and tablets running the software would go on sale on 29 July, at which point the OS would also be offered as a free download to existing users.

One analyst said the release was important as it might be ""Microsoft's last chance"" to crack the tablet market before Android and iOS became too entrenched, but added that it was unlikely to drive demand for new equipment in the same way earlier Windows updates had done. ""Microsoft and Intel are certainly pushing the two-in-one device strategy [in which laptops transform into tablets], which could result in some sales,"" said Michael Silver from the tech consultancy Gartner. ""But it's not only the fact that the upgrade is free, but Windows 10 for PCs is designed to run on computers that ran Windows 7 and even do better on less powerful hardware, so it will not spur on sales to the same extent as we've seen in the past.""","Microsoft's next generation of its operating system, Windows 10, is due to be released next month.","PCs and tablets running the software will go on sale on 29 July.

"Ildar Dadin is serving two and a half years for a series of street protests. He told his lawyer that he had been strung up by his handcuffed wrists, had his head shoved down a toilet and been threatened with rape and death. Russia's prison service says the claims are untrue but will investigate if the activist complains formally. Unusually, the allegations made the headlines on state-controlled television on Tuesday after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the case merited ""the closest attention"" and that President Vladimir Putin would be informed. Dadin's supporters gathered outside the justice ministry on Tuesday evening in protest. Ildar Dadin, 34, says his problems began after he was transferred to Prison Number Seven in the Karelia region of north-western Russia in mid-September and sent directly to a punishment cell. More on this story: Now out of isolation, Dadin has dictated a letter to his wife via his lawyer, in which he says he was beaten and kicked repeatedly by up to a dozen prison staff. One day, he alleges, he was hung from his wrists for about half an hour causing ""extreme pain"". ""They then took off my pants and said that they would bring in another prisoner who would rape me if I didn't agree to end my hunger strike,"" Ildar Dadin writes. He had stopped eating in protest at being held in a punishment cell. Russia's FSIN prison service told the BBC that Mr Dadin was put in isolation for what a spokeswoman called ""violations of the detention regime"", but insisted that his claims of beating and torture were false. ""There's no way illegal methods were used, especially for such a well-known character,"" Kristina Belousova told the BBC by telephone. ""It's not the first time we've seen this, by people trying to attract maximum attention,"" the spokeswoman added. Ildar Dadin was sentenced in December 2015, under Article 212.1 - a controversial law that makes repeat violations of Russia's strict laws on street protests a criminal offence. ""We didn't expect this to happen. It's awful,"" lawyer Alexei Liptser told the BBC, after visiting his client on Monday and transcribing his account. ""He is frightened and subdued,"" the lawyer added. As the allegations of abuse spread on social media, and reached the Kremlin, Russia's human rights ombudswoman ordered a regional representative to visit the prison and said she was taking the case under her ""personal control"". In a dramatic conclusion to his letter, Ildar Dadin tells his wife ""I am not afraid of dying. I'm most afraid of not being able to tolerate the torture.""",Russian officials are investigating claims that a well-known opposition activist has been repeatedly beaten and threatened in prison.,"Ildar Dadin is serving two and a half years for a series of street protests.

"Coatbridge College head John Doyle was given the money after his institution merged with two other colleges. Holyrood's public audit committee, which said the principal was paid ""in excess of the guidelines"", has passed its report to Police Scotland. Mr Doyle told MSPs in October he had done nothing wrong and that his reputation had been unfairly ""trashed"". In June, the Auditor General Caroline Gardner issued a highly-critical report of the severance deals paid out by Coatbridge College, which she said were overly-generous. She claimed Mr Doyle and chairman of the former college - John Gray - had colluded in order to ""achieve a certain outcome"" by withholding important information from the remuneration committee. The report by the Scottish Parliament's audit committee agreed with the auditor general. Mr Doyle, who earned £116,000 a year by the end of his service, was given: Six other college staff also benefited from the £850,000 pot of pay-off money. Police Scotland said that officers had had discussions with Audit Scotland and the ""matter is under review"". Following the report, the Scottish government said it would ""carefully consider its [the report's] recommendations in the coming days"". Committee convener Paul Martin said: ""There is a compelling moral argument for John Doyle to repay the tens of thousands of pounds extra he received from the college. ""The Scottish government provided more than £52m between 2011/12 and 2013/14 to support the college merger process and most of that money was used to fund voluntary severance schemes. ""It was not provided however to allow already highly-paid public servants to feather their own nests at the expense of their colleagues and of their students' education."" The report made key recommendations, including; A Scottish government spokeswoman said the way in which ""decisions involving hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money were made at Coatbridge College were completely unacceptable"". She added: ""The events in question took place before April 2014 when colleges were reclassified by ONS and stronger financial controls came into effect."" By Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland political correspondent MSPs on Holyrood's public audit committee were unanimous. Their report into bumper pay-offs for Coatbridge college bosses finds that the principal, John Doyle, was responsible for ""serious failings in the governance of severance arrangements"". It says he colluded with the chairman, John Gray to secure ""excessive"" pay-offs for himself and six other senior managers by deliberately withholding information from those who signed off the deals. The committee is urging Mr Doyle to pay back much of his £304,000 golden goodbye. They say this request and their decision to copy their report to Police Scotland are without precedent. Mr Doyle has previously refused to pay back any money arguing that he has ""done nothing wrong"". Mr Gray has also denied collusion. The committee convenor, Paul Martin, says in these circumstances the charity regulator or the Scottish Funding Council should think creatively about how they could force a clawback. The difficulty with these demands is that what MSPs find morally questionable may prove to be contractually correct.","A former college principal should hand back some of his £304,000 severance pay, a committee of MSPs has concluded.","Holyrood's public audit committee has passed its report to Police Scotland.

"Researchers said they found German coins minted during World War Two in the ruins in northern Argentina. The researchers said that the buildings were probably never used by fugitive Nazis, because they found they could live freely in Argentine towns. Nazis who fled to Argentina included Adolf Eichmann and Erich Priebke. The researchers from the University of Buenos Aires said they decided to investigate the buildings because of a local legend claiming they had been used as a hide-out for Martin Bormann, a close aide to Adolf Hitler. The overgrown ruins are located in Teyu Cuare park, near the town of San Ignacio in northern Misiones province. Researcher Daniel Schavelzon told Argentina's Clarin newspaper that the architecture of the three buildings differed markedly from that of others in the region and that their purpose in the middle of a remote nature reserve was a mystery. He said that a number of objects had been found that linked the buildings to wartime Germany, such as coins minted in the late 1930s and early 1940s and a fragment of Meissen porcelain made in Germany. However, none of the objects has so far been found to have any direct links to any Nazi officers. Mr Schavelzon told Clarin that his team thought previous theories, such as that the building had been built by Jesuit priests, were ""too simplistic"". He also dismissed the local legend that Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann had lived there. Mr Schavelzon pointed to DNA tests carried out in 1998 on a skeleton found in Berlin that proved Bormann committed suicide in 1945 and did not flee to South America as had long been rumoured. The researcher insisted, though, that the buildings in Teyu Cuare park were very unusual. He said the walls, some of which were 3m (9ft) thick, were ""on an incredible scale"". He also said that their location was ""completely inaccessible"". ""You'd never be able to find them if you didn't know their exact location,"" he said. He said the theory the team was currently working on was that the buildings were constructed as a hide-out by the Nazis in case they lost World War Two. But he said he did not think it was ever used, as the Nazis found they could live in relative comfort in Argentine cities rather than have to hide in a remote jungle fortress. Hundreds of Nazis and fascists, some of them wanted war criminals, were allowed to enter Argentina by the president at the time, Juan Peron. Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer who oversaw the logistics of the Holocaust, famously lived in a suburb of Buenos Aires for years before being captured by Israeli agents. In 2000, then-president Fernando de la Rua apologised for Argentina's role in providing a refuge for Nazi war criminals after World War Two.",Archaeologists are trying to determine whether ruined buildings in a remote nature reserve in Argentina were built as a hide-out for German Nazi officers.,"Overgrown ruins are located in Teyu Cuare park, in northern Misiones province. Researchers said they found German coins minted during World War Two in the ruins. Local legend claimed they had been used as a hide-out for Martin Bormann, a close aide to Adolf Hitler. But researchers said the buildings were probably never used by fugitive Nazis, because they could live freely in Argentine towns."
"Anti-smoking groups say that is too long to wait, but there have been protests by some restaurant owners, who say their business will suffer. Austrians like order, or ""Ordnung"" as they say in German. It is hugely frowned upon for a pedestrian to cross the road on a red light. And the streets and underground network of Vienna are kept remarkably clean. But smoky air in cafes and restaurants has been widely tolerated for years. ""Smoking is a sort of culture, especially in Austria,"" Margit Schwed told me as she sat in Cafe Ritter in Vienna, with its gilt chandeliers and marble table tops. ""In the typical Vienna Kaffeehaus you take your coffee and your cigarette. I think people like the flair in the coffee houses."" Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people: 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more. A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area. Several years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas. Small restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not. Larger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions. The law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced. Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018. ""We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,"" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said. However there were protests from the far-right Freedom Party and from Austria's Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce opposes the ban, because it says restaurants and cafes invested around â‚¬100m ($109m; Â£714m) to install ventilation systems and glass partitions to accommodate the separate smoking areas. The economy minister, Reinhold Mitterlehner, has said their interests will be taken into account. At Cafe Ritter, one of the waiters, Michael Schneider, told me the smoking ban should be brought in as soon as possible. ""Working in the smoke is bad for the health of me and my colleagues,"" he said.","After years of debate, Austria's government has announced plans to introduce a total smoking ban in cafes and restaurants by 2018.","Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people. 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area."

"Fees in England are rising again, and it is the first fall in UK applications since fees were last increased in 2012. The Royal College of Nursing blamed the 23% drop in nursing applications on the removal of bursaries. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said that despite the overall drop, more 18-year-olds were applying to university. These Ucas admissions figures, up to the January deadline for courses starting in the autumn, show a 5% drop in UK students and 7% drop in students from the European Union - with a total of about 564,000. Universities have been warning about the impact of Brexit on their finances if European applications fall and these figures show a significant decline in candidates from the EU. There has also been a decline in UK students applying - and like the two previous occasions when applications have fallen - this has been when fees are being increased. The fall in applications in England of 6% has been three times greater than in Scotland at 2%, which remains without tuition fees. Applications from Wales fell most, by 7%, and Northern Ireland by 5%. Nursing had the biggest fall of any individual subject, and Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, blamed this on the switch from grants to fees and loans. ""We warned the government the removal of student funding would see a sharp drop in nursing applications. These figures confirm our worst fears,"" said Ms Davies. She said the ""nursing workforce is in crisis"". But there were drops across other subjects - particularly among older students not applying directly from school. Among 19-year-olds, numbers were down 9%. And among 25-year-olds, applications were down 23%. But among 18-year-olds, such as sixth-formers applying from school, numbers have continued to rise to record levels, up to 37% of the age group. And there could be an upside for those who are seeking places - with universities likely to be competing to attract students. Ucas chief Mary Curnock Cook said this ""tough recruitment environment for universities"" would mean ""unprecedented choice and opportunity for applicants"". Sorana Vieru, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said the fall in applicants was ""disappointing, but not a surprise"". ""Uncertainty around increases in tuition fees, loss of maintenance grants and the rising costs of living and studying at university are too much of a risk to some potential students,"" she said. Labour's shadow universities minister, Gordon Marsden, said: ""We warned the government at Christmas their sneaked-out tuition fee increases and the accompanying increased debts would have damaging impacts on students and their numbers."" Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""More young people than ever are choosing to go to university, with record application rates for 18-year-olds this year as well as those from disadvantaged backgrounds.""",University applications have fallen by 5% - with the decline driven by a drop in European Union students and a sharp fall in nursing applications.,"Fees in England are rising again, and it is the first fall in UK applications since fees were last increased in 2012.

"There are concerns about the number of deaths at the hospital, which is at the centre of a long dispute over the future of children's heart services. The medical director of the NHS, Bruce Keogh, said it was ""a highly responsible precautionary step"". But some people have questioned the decision and its timing, 24 hours after a High Court ruling kept surgery there. Leeds General Infirmary had been earmarked for closure by the NHS review to concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer bigger centres. But that decision was quashed by a High Court judge on Wednesday. Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, who has led a cross-party campaign to keep the unit open, said it was a ""very odd"" decision coming after the jubilation that greeted the court ruling. ""We have always asked them 'is it safe at Leeds?' and the answer always came back 'yes it is'. ""What is the information that says that has changed?"" Congenital heart defects explained He added he had not received one complaint about care. Children who would have been treated in Leeds will be sent to other hospitals around England. Affected families are being contacted directly by the trust and the review is expected to take three weeks. Anne Keatley-Clarke, chief executive of the Children's Heart Federation, an umbrella group for different voluntary organisations, said she had raised concerns about surgery outcomes two years ago, and more recently parents had reported difficulties in getting referrals at Leeds to other heart units. In a statement on the federation website, she said: ""My concern is that it appears that managers and clinicians in  Leeds, together with the parent support group, have put their own interests ahead of the well-being of critically ill children and their very vulnerable parents."" Sir Bruce and senior managers from the Care Quality Commission visited the hospital on Thursday to say it must stop all children's heart surgery there immediately. In a statement, Sir Bruce said: ""The trust has taken a highly responsible precautionary step. ""Some questions have been raised by the trust's own mortality data and by other information. ""It is important to understand that while this information raises questions, it does not give us answers."" The chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said outside experts would be drafted in to help review ""all aspects"" of care. In a statement, Maggie Boyle apologised to parents and families affected but assured them the trust always put the safety of patients first. The CQC said it supported the trust's decision and it was in close contact with the trust to ensure effective arrangements were in place to protect the safety and welfare of patients. Sharon Cheng, from Save Our Surgery - the group which is co-ordinating the fight to keep children's heart surgery in Leeds - said: ""We're mystified. ""We don't know of anything that could justify this step."" Previously, an NHS review said surgery should stop at hospitals in Leeds, Leicester and London to focus care at fewer, larger sites, where medical expertise can be concentrated. More than 600,000 people signed a petition opposing the closure plans. Many people were unhappy that children from Leeds faced journeys of up to 150 miles for care. The leader of Leeds City Council, Councillor Keith Wakefield, said he was ""shocked at the timing of today's events"".",Children's congenital heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary has been suspended as a review is carried out.,Leeds General Infirmary had been earmarked for closure by the NHS review.

"A metal detectorist found three jugs and a bronze dish in a field in Kelshall near Royston last year, North Hertfordshire District Council said.

"Conservative MPs cheered as English and Welsh members prepared to give their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies.

"Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called Labour ""careless"" for spending European Union (EU) money on ineligible projects and the Conservatives ""mean-spirited"" to use flood relief money to repay the wrongly used funds. The government blamed Labour's ""mismanagement"" of the money. Labour has been approached for comment. Local government minister Andrew Percy, revealed in a written statement that £15m EU Solidarity Funding received in respect of the winter 2015-16 floods would be ""offset"" by the £14.5m repayment. The UK was ""legally obliged"" to make the repayment because there had been ""ineligible spending under the Labour administration"" of 2007 funding. The remaining £500,000 was ""only eligible to reimburse"" the government for financial support given to affected areas, he said. Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Mr Farron said the two parties had ""combined to deprive flood-hit areas of much needed funds"". ""Labour's overspending has hurt the North and all those affected by last year's floods,"" he said. ""But it is the Conservative's mean-spiritedness which means they have chosen to use this money to pay the fine, instead of passing this money on to flood-affected areas and paying the fine from Treasury coffers.""

The force said it would now work with the club to agree what money, ""if anything"", remains outstanding. Two years ago, the High Court ruled the force overcharged for ""special police services"" between 2009 and 2012.

"At the time Laachraoui was known as ""Abou Idriss"", a lawyer for two of the ex-hostages told French media. The hostages were freed in April 2014. Laachraoui and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui died when they attacked Brussels Zaventem airport a month ago. Their bombs and a third in the metro killed 32 people. The confirmation about Laachraoui's role as an IS prison guard in Syria came from lawyer Marie-Laure Ingouf. Laachraoui was a 24-year-old Belgian electrical engineer from the Brussels suburb of Schaerbeek. He had links to the jihadists who attacked Paris in 2015. The French daily Le Parisien reports that Laachraoui kept watch over the four Frenchmen with Mehdi Nemmouche, the jihadist accused of killing four people at the Brussels Jewish Museum in May 2014. Nemmouche is now in Belgian custody. The Frenchmen - Didier Francois, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Nicolas Henin - spent 10 months in IS captivity. They had been captured in June 2013. Laachraoui and Nemmouche disappeared at the end of January 2014, according to the ex-hostages.","One of the Brussels airport bombers, Najim Laachraoui, guarded four French journalists who were held hostage by so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria in 2013-2014, the ex-hostages say.","Laachraoui was a 24-year-old Belgian electrical engineer from Schaerbeek.

"The 24-year-old, whose Colchester contract was due to run out this summer, has agreed a deal until 2017. He has scored 14 times in 29 games for the League One strugglers this season, having started the campaign with a career tally of 25 goals. ""I enjoyed my time at Colchester, but my ultimate goal was to move back up the leagues,"" he told the club website. ""This is a great opportunity to do that with a team heading in the right direction. ""I got the call on Thursday and I was down here that night, got the medical done, and I was signing Friday morning."" Sears will be competing with Daryl Murphy, David McGoldrick and Noel Hunt for a place in Mick McCarthy's side. The former England Under-21 international began his career with West Ham and was tipped for big things after scoring the winning goal on his debut for the Hammers, aged 18, in a 2-1 Premier League victory over Blackburn in March 2008. However, he was unable to establish a regular place in the side and had loan spells at Crystal Palace, Coventry and Scunthorpe, before joining Colchester three years ago. Promotion-chasing Ipswich, third in the Championship, allowed striker Conor Sammon to end his loan spell from Derby this week to join Rotherham. Colchester, who are 22nd in League One, must now face a relegation battle without their top scorer.

"Media playback is not supported on this device Cook, 32, resigned in February and in his first match under replacement Joe Root made 69 as England defeated South Africa by 211 runs at Lord's. ""I was having a laugh watching him in the field, running around in the covers,"" said Bayliss. ""He looked like he was enjoying it. For someone at this stage of his career, that's a good sign."" Like Cook before him, Root began his reign as captain with a victory, scoring 190 in the first innings to help rescue England from 76-4. At 26, the Yorkshire batsman had only captained in four previous first-class matches before taking on the England job. ""Before this Test he was a little more on edge than I've seen him before,"" said Bayliss. ""We spoke about Joe being himself, getting the message across in his way. ""He's proactive and confident and I thought that came across in the way he led the team. ""Root and Cook are different characters, they go about their batting in different fashion, so the dressing room was a little different. A lot of the messages were similar, just delivered in a different way."" England have named an unchanged 12-man squad for the second Test of the four-match series against the Proteas at Trent Bridge, which begins on Friday. That means the balance of the team is likely to remain the same, with left-arm spinner Liam Dawson continuing alongside Moeen Ali, who took 10 wickets at Lord's. ""The combination we had you could pretty much pick on any type of wicket,"" added Australian Bayliss, who further clarified Moeen's role in the team after saying on Sunday he thought his man-of-the-match performance could be a ""watershed"" moment. ""He wants to be in the team as a batter who bowls a little bit, so that is what we have chosen him as,"" said Bayliss. ""Mo is a bit of a complex character at times, so it's more for his benefit than anything. It takes the pressure off him. It doesn't mean he can't be the best spinner, but his number one job is to bat. ""This Test was probably a sign that this is the best way to go with him."" Media playback is not supported on this device By BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Alastair Cook looks like has he gulped in a huge breath of fresh air by giving up the captaincy. I interviewed him on the fourth morning and was able to draw a comparison between the Cook of now and the Cook I spoke to after the fifth Test against India in Chennai last year. It was like a different man. Cook will not be a grumpy old pro, chuntering in the corner as the team move on. He will enjoy his cricket and bat the way he does. The 69 he made in the second innings was classic Cook - playing nicely without taking the attack apart. With his schedule - no one-day internationals - he could play Tests for a long time to come.

"Gemma Flanagan rolled herself down the catwalk for the first time at a London fashion event on Wednesday. ""It was so amazing to do it and not fall off. My biggest worry was I'd roll off the end or the side,"" she said. Before an illness left her unable to walk, she worked as an air hostess and part-time model. ""I surprisingly felt just as confident as I have done in the past which, considering it was the first one in my chair, I wasn't sure how I'd cope with. ""When you're walking you can kind of have a little strut and do your thing. That's what I was worried about - not being able to show the clothes off as well. ""The designer's just so pleased with how I showcased their items and at the end of the day that's what modelling's about."" The fashion show was planned by the group Models of Diversity which campaigns for the fashion and beauty industries to represent diversity, and took place at the Ideal Home Show in London's Olympia. Gemma, who is celebrating her 32nd birthday this week, wants using disabled models to be the norm. ""The more people that are open to using models with disabilities then the more people will see it as normal. ""We've all been in campaigns that have been a one-off for companies and a lot of them aren't paid either. ""It would be good to use models with disabilities just as models, not as one-offs - we're better than that,"" she says. As for her future, she says: ""I've got a hair show in May and a couple of shoots lined up with local photographers. ""I want to do a lot more using my chair. I'm in it near enough all of the time now. Part of me doing this show was to embrace myself and embrace the fact that the chair isn't the enemy anymore. ""It's basically seeing past the metal and the wheels and just saying, 'that's a gorgeous model' rather than 'a girl in a chair'."" In 2011 Gemma was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome, a serious condition which affects the nervous system. She spent seven months in rehab trying to learn to speak, write and walk again. Recently though she says she's found it harder to walk with crutches and has become increasingly reliant on her wheelchair. ""When I got ill they were hoping I'd make a full recovery,"" she said.

"Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai issued the recall soon after its cameras were identified as aiding the massive web attacks. They made access to popular websites, such as Reddit, Twitter, Spotify and many other sites, intermittent. Security experts said easy-to-guess default passwords, used on Xiongmai webcams, aided the hijacking. The web attack enrolled thousands of devices that make up the internet of things - smart devices used to oversee homes and which can be controlled remotely. In a statement, Hangzhou Xiongmai said hackers were able to take over the cameras because users had not changed the devices' default passwords. Xiongmai rejected suggestions that its webcams made up the bulk of the devices used in the attacks. ""Security issues are a problem facing all mankind,"" it said. ""Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too."" It has also pledged to improve the way it uses passwords on its products and will send customers a software patch to harden devices against attack. The recall affects all the circuit boards and components made by Hangzhou Xiongmai that go into webcams. It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks. Yes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks. Before the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want. For the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle. And because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders. Not easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed. There is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating. Also, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available. Because security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales. Despite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working. Right now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can. In one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.",Home webcams that were hijacked to help knock popular websites offline last week are being recalled in the US.,"Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai issued the recall soon after its cameras were identified as aiding the massive web attacks.

"Thomas Wainwright was on the wrong side of the road and travelling at speeds of up to 95mph in his Maserati hire car, just minutes before the crash.

The court heard Wainwright had been drinking cider and whisky for eight and a half hours before the crash. He will be sentenced next month. During the trial Wainwright and his passenger,  42-year-old Jerome Lopez, had claimed that Miss Wade had been on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident but the jury did not believe them. Witnesses from Mull told how Wainwright, who was with Mr Lopez, his mother's partner, had been drinking at a hotel, a pub and a distillery in Tobermory before having another two pints of cider in the Craignure Inn. As he headed back towards Tobermory on the wrong side of the road his hire car smashed into the van driven by Miss Wade. The court heard Wainwright was on Mull, along with members of his family, visiting his sick grandmother. He had flown into Edinburgh airport and hired the Maserati. Prosecutor Tim Niven-Smith revealed that Wainwright, who worked as the first officer on the Â£6.26m yacht MY Mahogany based in the south of France, had a previous conviction for driving while unfit through drink or drugs. At a court in Nice he was fined 700 euros and given a suspended sentence.
