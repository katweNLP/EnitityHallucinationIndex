"Voges was forced to retire hurt on 86 after suffering the injury while batting during the County Championship draw with Somerset on 4 June.

"Seven photographs taken in the Norfolk countryside by photographer Josh Olins will appear in the June edition. In her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes. The shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition. The duchess, who has a keen interest in photography, has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery since 2012. Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: ""Josh has captured the duchess exactly as she is - full of life, with a great sense of humour, thoughtful and intelligent, and in fact, very beautiful."" He said the images also encapsulated what Vogue had done over the past 100 years - ""to pair the best photographers with the great personalities of the day, in order to reflect broader shifts in culture and society"". Alexandra Shulman, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, said: ""To be able to publish a photographic shoot with the Duchess of Cambridge has been one of my greatest ambitions for the magazine."" The collaboration for the June edition had resulted in ""a true celebration of our centenary as well as a fitting tribute to a young woman whose interest in both photography and the countryside is well known"", she said. Other royal portraits to have featured in the fashion magazine include Diana, Princess of Wales - who graced the cover four times - and Princess Anne.

It has gone on to be closely associated with offensive and often illegal activity, including instances where the images of child abuse were shared. It was widely credited as being the first place where leaked images of nude celebrities were posted following 2014's well-publicised security breach affecting Apple's iCloud service. That incident prompted a policy change on the site.

Vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu now takes over from the 49-year-old Rosell, who came to power in 2010. Rosell's future has been a real source of concern ever since a Spanish national court judge accepted a lawsuit this week from Barcelona club member Jordi Cases, who alleged that the amount paid for Neymar was more than the reported fee. Rosell maintains the accusation is ""unfair and reckless"". He added: ""For some time, my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence. These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardise my family. ""From the beginning, I have said the signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries.""

"The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead. The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000. The government said London was the highest funded part of the country. It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average. But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance. Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200. It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures. In a statement, London Councils said: ""At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country."" It added: ""Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy.

"His 110 means he has scored 323 runs in a week after an unbeaten 93 against Glamorgan in the One-Day Cup and 120 not out against Kent in the T20 Blast.

"Ms Kendall told the BBC Labour risked sending a ""resignation letter to the British people as a serious party of government"" by electing Mr Corbyn. Separately, Ms Cooper warned there was a ""serious risk the party will split"" if the left-winger becomes its leader. It comes as Labour begins sending out the first ballot papers to voters. The result of the contest will be announced at a special conference on 12 September. More than 600,000 people have signed up to vote in the four-way contest but Labour has said applications are still being verified. 610,753 total electorate, though this may fall as party removes those not entitled to vote Of which, full party members:  299,755 Affiliated to a trade union:  189,703 Registered to vote by paying Â£3:  121,295 Meanwhile voting in the election for the new Scottish Labour leader ended at midday. Mr Corbyn is due to unveil a 10-point policy plan while in Glasgow later. The popularity of the left-wing Islington North MP, who is promising ""a new kind of politics"", has sparked a row about the future direction of the Labour party. Another leadership contender, Andy Burnham, told the BBC Mr Corbyn's policies ""lack credibility"". ""It's not possible to promise free university education, re-nationalising the utilities, without that coming at a great cost and if you can't explain how that is going to be paid for then I don't think we'll win back the trust of voters on the economy,"" he said. BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there had been ""frustration"" in rival camps who accused Mr Burnham of being reluctant to take on Mr Corbyn. This appeared to be his most direct attack yet, he added. But in an interview with Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2, Mr Burnham declined to follow Ms Kendall and Ms Cooper and advise his supporters not to back Mr Corbyn with their second and third preferences. He added: ""People will say if they hear things like that, 'hang on, what do you believe?'"" In an interview with The Independent, Ms Kendall called for voters to mark Ms Cooper or Mr Burnham as second and third preferences, and avoid giving votes to Mr Corbyn. ""I have set out very clearly where I differ with all the candidates but our differences with Jeremy's kind of politics are far greater,"" said Ms Kendall. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said she ""can't pretend to be agnostic"" about a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying of the voting process: ""It is an alternative vote system and I want to urge party members to use all of their different preferences. ""I will be using my second and third preferences and I would urge others to do the same because I don't want to see our party go back to the politics of the '80s, just being a party of protest."" The Leicester West MP also said she did not see the party splitting, as it did in the 1980s when Labour members formed the Social Democratic Party. However, Ms Cooper told BBC 2's Newsnight: ""I think there is a serious risk that the party will split, will polarise and I cannot bear to see that happen because there is too much at stake."" Asked in an interview with grassroots Labour website Labourlist whether voters should use their votes to try to prevent Mr Corbyn winning, she said: ""I think people should use all of their preferences. ""And I think the focus has to be how do we make sure we can win that election, and that's the most important thing - and I don't think Jeremy can do that."" Mr Corbyn has warned against ""personal abuse"" in the campaign, saying he wants to focus on policy. His policy programme includes a commitment to ""growth not austerity"", nationalising the railways and energy sector, and a plan for nuclear disarmament. In an essay for the Fabian Society he also suggested Labour's new increased following should be more involved in the party and proposed a review of membership fees to make the party more ""inclusive"". Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to join the debate over the leadership contest with a speech on Sunday, called ""power for a purpose - the future of the Labour Party"". Lance Price, former director of communications for Labour, told the BBC the contest had been an ""unedifying mess"" and had ""done nothing to reengage the labour party with those millions of people who deserted it"". The Guardian newspaper has endorsed Ms Cooper for the leadership while the Daily Mirror has given its backing to Mr Burnham, although the paper urged him to ""find a role"" in his team for Mr Corbyn, who it says has ""lit up the election campaign"".",Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have said their supporters should back anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn in the contest.," More than 600,000 people have signed up to vote in the four-way contest .

"The Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020. The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead. Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham. She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue. It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years. Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets. ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much. The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget. Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools. One respondent said his school was moving to a ""bare bones education"", in which ""the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away"". Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support. More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education. And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips. Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects. Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level. Another said: ""Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!"" One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to ""creak"" with all staff working to full capacity. Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: ""School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need. ""Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people."" A spokesman for the DfE said: ""As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential. ""The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019-20.""","Head teachers say they are axing GCSE and A-level subjects, increasing class sizes and cutting support services as they struggle with school funding."," Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020 .

"Ann Barnes dealt with an ""ill-advised"" TV documentary, a probe into her car insurance, and youth commissioners who both had to step away from their role. But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success. She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work. ""Apart from one or two things I'd rather not have happened, I've really, really had a good time,"" she said. Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: ""You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it."" Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports. ""[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does.

Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract. After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced. Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's ""open and transparent"" culture.

"Taylor, 25, joined County in May from Macclesfield, but has yet to start in the league. The move has left Newport with only one goalkeeper in Joe Day, but manager John Sheridan is confident he will quickly fill the vacancy.

"The referendum will take place on 10 March, but Bath Conservative MP Ben Howlett said he was concerned about a ""lack of awareness"" about the issue. Mr Howlett also said he is worried about the public's level of engagement. Bath and North East Somerset Council said the referendum had been publicised in press releases and tweets. It also said it was the subject of a two-page article in the winter edition of the council magazine which was distributed to all households in the region. A further news release and polling cards will also be sent out to all households this week, the authority added. Supporters of the referendum say Bath needs a mayor to give local government more visibility. Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum. Mr Howlett said he was ""personally concerned"" that an elected mayor was not appropriate for an area ""as diverse"" as Bath and North East Somerset, and that it could ""lead to an increase in the cost of local politics"". ""The level of misinformation on this issue is worrying - many people seem to still believe this is about a mayor of Bath and not understanding it would cover all of Bath and North East Somerset.

"More than a dozen men stormed into the Kiwi cafe in the Georgian capital on Sunday evening, the cafe said, shouting and throwing meat at patrons. A brawl erupted but the attackers fled before police arrived. Police are now investigating, and say they have questioned the attackers and cafe staff. Nobody has been arrested. The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis. The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi. They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute. The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings. Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West. The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of ""the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat"" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. ""During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!"" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook. It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying ""to defend those fascists"". It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents. The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia. Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say. The country made world headlines in 2013 when a small group of LGBT activists were attacked by a large mob led by an orthodox priest. The cafe statement blames Sunday's incident on the group of men who came into the premises, talking loudly, throwing meat and smoking, and then ""yelling, laughing, and talking to us sarcastically"". These people ""were neo-Nazis... who support fascist ideas"", the cafe said. Some minor injuries were sustained. The police arrived only after the attackers had left, but the cafe said even some of those officers behaved aggressively, ""yelled with anger, said that we are guilty of what had happened"".",A vegan cafe in Tbilisi has appealed for public solidarity after being invaded by ultra-nationalists wielding grilled meat and sausages.," More than a dozen men stormed into the Kiwi cafe in Tbilisi, Georgia, shouting and throwing meat at patrons .

"The New Zealander made only one unenforced switch, bringing in Rhys Webb for Gareth Davies at scrum-half. Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Alex Cuthbert miss out with injuries.

Flanker Justin Tipuric, second row Luke Charteris and Hallam Amos are drafted in to the team in place of the injured players. Dan Lydiate will captain the side in the absence of Warburton and regular stand-in Jones. Gatland said he had shown faith in players who had performed well in earlier matches, a fact he acknowledged was hard on hooker Ken Owens who makes his fourth appearance on the bench in this Six Nations championship.

"Then playing for Walsall, the 24-year-old won his first senior cap for Wales in their defeat by Ukraine in March, giving him the chance to rub shoulders with the duo. Injury dashed his hopes of joining them at Euro 2016, however. ""They constantly want to improve and get better so that's something every footballer should apply to their game,"" Bradshaw told BBC Radio Wales. Media playback is not supported on this device Wales have been buoyed by the success of Arsenal midfielder Ramsey and Real Madrid forward Bale in 2016 as they reached the semi-finals of the European Championships, their first international tournament for 58 years. Bradshaw, who has scored three goals in 19 appearances for the Tykes this season, puts the success of the pair down to two factors. ""You watch them train and you watch them play and you try to pick their brains about how they managed to get to that level,"" he said. ""A lot of it is natural ability and natural talent, but the thing that strikes me is their hunger; their hunger to want to improve even though Gareth's playing for Real Madrid and he's a massive part of his country's team."" Bradshaw says he was ""gutted"" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention. The former Aberystwyth Town player has since concentrated on boosting his future Wales hopes by performing well for his new club Barnsley. ""It was incredibly frustrating, with hindsight as well, at how well the lads did,"" he said. ""I was incredibly proud of the boys and how impressive they were at the Euros. I was gutted, but that's football. Unfortunately that was part and parcel of the game. ""But I picked my head up and managed to get a move to the Championship and I'm just trying to improve. It hurt for a while. It took for the majority of that summer for me to get over it. ""I was watching all the games and cheering the lads on from afar, but it was invaluable experience for me to go away to Portugal although I didn't manage to train that much because of the injury, it's all experience that I've enjoyed and hopefully I can put it into good use in the future and hopefully one day I'll get an opportunity again.""",Barnsley striker Tom Bradshaw says every footballer can learn from the examples set by Wales stars Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.," Wales reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016 after reaching first semi-final for 58 years .

"John MacIntosh, 46, of Dingwall, must serve at least 10 years in prison after being convicted by a jury of four serious sexual offences. At the High Court in Aberdeen, judge Lord Uist said MacIntosh was a ""sexual fiend"" who targeted vulnerable females. MacIntosh had previously been jailed for seven years for having sex with 13 and 14-year-old girls. The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004. He sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the young girl and raped three women. In his sentencing statement, Lord Uist said: ""You targeted vulnerable females in order to gratify your carnal lust. ""You have called all these women liars and shown no remorse for what you did."" The judge added: ""It is clear to me that you have no respect for women and are a sexual fiend."" Lord Uist said MacIntosh should not assume that he would be automatically released after having served 10 years in prison. He said: ""You will be released only when the Parole Board for Scotland is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you continue to be held in prison."" Police Scotland has welcomed the life sentence. Det Insp Eddie Ross said the case was brought to the attention of police by the NHS.

"A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire. Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack. A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack. Islamic State militants also operate in the area. Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan. The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand. It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May. Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province. In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched. It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police. Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike. In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure. The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations. Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops. Afghanistan has been hit by numerous violent attacks in recent weeks with the launch of the Taliban's spring offensive, including a massive bomb attack in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 150 people.","Three US special forces soldiers have been shot dead by an Afghan colleague during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, US officials say.", Afghan commando opened fire on US troops during a joint operation in Nangahar province .

"Cathay is one of the world's biggest cargo airlines, and its decision is expected to have a sizeable impact. Previously, the airline had said it would only transport shark fin that was sustainably sourced. Shark fin is considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine and is often served as a soup at upmarket banquets. More than 70 million sharks are killed every year, according to WWF figures. Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China. ""On the issue of shark's fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday. It said it had not approved any shark fin shipments over the last year, pointing out that it had turned down 15 shipment requests for shark-related products. Early reports said the ban extended to all shark products on cargo and passenger flights, but the airline told the BBC it currently applied to shark fin only, Cathay said it would continue to review its policy. Marine conservationists hailed Cathay's decision, with one proclaiming that it would make Hong Kong ""proud"". ""More Hong Kong businesses need to follow the lead,"" Hong Kong-based conservationist Sharon Kwok told AFP. Government data cited by the South China Morning Post shows that shark fin imports to Hong Kong dropped by 42% between 2010 and 2015 to 5,717 tonnes.

"The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project. The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering. The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle. The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link. ""Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,"" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark. Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations. These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts. Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests. The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area. Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.",Archaeologists in Denmark have uncovered an incredibly rare find: a stone age axe held within its wooden handle.," The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys on the Danish island of Lolland .

"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone. But last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood. Forestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting. You can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist. Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree. That's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens. The last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago. So Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees. Not all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk. The idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds. Well this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature. Robert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see. It's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year. Can we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference? Well yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree. Those branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden. It's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers. The trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future. Meaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees. The only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch. Fingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!",Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting.," Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree .

The health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to ""balance the books"". Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was ""gobsmacked"". ""I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,"" he said. ""We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured."" In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system. Source: NHS Assistant director at Guernsey's health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year. He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on ""the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years"". In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said. Commercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC. It is a legal requirement to provide a hyperbaric chamber facility for commercial diving activity to take place within Guernsey's 12-mile limit.","Divers in Guernsey will be hit with a £30,000 charge if they require treatment for decompression sickness, the government has confirmed."," Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was ""gobsmacked"" by the new charges .

"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. ""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months. Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say."," IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa .

"The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period. The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%. However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%. The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%. ""The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services. Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes. Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June. Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter. Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter. Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year. The International Monetary Fund this week cut its forecast for US economic growth, in part citing uncertainty over the chances for tax reform and infrastructure spending, policies that many say could provide an economic boost.",The US economy grew at a faster pace than previously thought in the first three months of the year.," US economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period .

More on this story and others from Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Norton, who uses the hashtag #walsallwee, said: ""It's been happening for more than two months and I reported it to the council but nothing happened. ""So I decided I had to take action myself because it was getting very depressing to see. ""I thought it was just happening at weekends, but when I saw the footage it was actually happening up to five times a day."" Deputy council leader Adrian Andrew said the authority is looking to establish a public space protection order in the town centre to combat anti-social behaviour. ""Officers are gathering information, which includes Mr Norton's evidence, and talking to other businesses in the area and the police to determine our next course of action,"" he said. ""Both myself and the majority of residents in Walsall are proud of this town. We've worked damn hard to attract investment here and I'm not going to allow the behaviour of a few to cause such a stink.""",A podiatrist fed up with men urinating outside his clinic has installed CCTV to catch them in the act and posted the images on social media., Chris Norton said he noticed men repeatedly using the wall at his premises as a toilet .

"Class-A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were among the illegal substances seized, according to the data from police in England and Wales. There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures from 34 police forces. Teachers described the statistics as a ""worry"" and the ""tip of the iceberg"". The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act. PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014. The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from. Just over three-quarters of forces replied. Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved. The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27. Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy. Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire. Only four incidents involved children under 11. An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug. There were 241 incidents involving 15- to 16-year-olds and 231 incidents involving 11- to 14-year-olds. In Greater Manchester, a 14-year-old was caught with heroin with a street value of £500, and a 16-year-old with a quantity worth £330. Other incidents involved parents or school employees, including a school gardener in Humberside and a cleaner at a Manchester primary. The highest number of incidents and offences in the three complete years to March 2014 was for Hampshire with 229 cases. There were 144 incidents in Avon and Somerset and 138 in the West Midlands. South Wales police reported 92 cases. There was a slight year-on-year decrease in the numbers which peaked at 657 in 2011-12 and fell to 611 and 560 in the next two years, while in the period March to December 2014, there were 407 incidents. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said any incident of drugs on school premises was ""worrying as it will often only be the tip of the iceberg of what young people are encountering on the streets. ""Teachers and school leaders are always alert to the potential for young people being involved in drug or alcohol abuse."" Ms Keates said many specialist programmes to help schools support and educate young people about substance abuse had been cut in recent years.","Hundreds of schoolchildren, among them a pupil of only eight, have been caught with drugs on school premises, new figures reveal."," There were more than 2,000 incidents from 2011 to 2014, suggest figures from 34 police forces .
