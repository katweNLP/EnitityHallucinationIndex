1. Count the entities in Input text, count the entities in the reference text, count entities in generated summary 
2. with respect to Input:
			a. find new entities in Reference summary - Hallucination
			b. find Lost entities in Reference summary - Unimportant 
			c. find the new entities in generated summary  - Hallucination
			d. Find lost entities in generated summary -  Lost Focus
3. with respect to the reference summary :
			a. Find the matching entities present in generated summary - Positive hallucination 
			b. Find the lost entities  in generated summary (check input)   - Lost Focus 
			c. Find the new entities present in generated summary - Negative hallucination 

2.a Hallucination in reference summary : |x| means count  
		|entities not present in input |/ | entities present in  reference | 
2.b unimportant in reference summary  : 
        | entities not present in reference |/ | entities present in  input | 
2.c Hallucination in generated summary :
        |entities not present in input |/ | entities present in  generated summary  | 		
2.d Lost entities in generated summary :
		|entities not present in generated |/ | entities present in input  | 		


3. a Positive hallucination in generated summary :    <<<< should be closer to 1
        (2*| matching entities | ) /  ( | entities in reference| + |entities in generated|)  =====  check only hallucinated entities
3  b Lost focus  in generated summary :  
        | Entities not present in ref wrt generated (but present in input) | /  | entities present in  generated | 
3  c Negative hallucination in generated summary :
        | Entities not present in reference text (& entities not present input)  | /  | entities present in generated |
