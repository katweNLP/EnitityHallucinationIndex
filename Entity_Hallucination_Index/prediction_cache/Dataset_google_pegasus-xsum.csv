"The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead. The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000. The government said London was the highest funded part of the country. It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average. But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance. Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200. It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures.

"The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project. The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering. The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle. The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link. ""Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,"" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark. Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations. These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts. Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests. The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area.

""I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,"" he said. ""We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured."" In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system. Source: NHS Assistant director at Guernsey's health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year. He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on ""the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years"". In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said. Commercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC. It is a legal requirement to provide a hyperbaric chamber facility for commercial diving activity to take place within Guernsey's 12-mile limit.","Divers in Guernsey will be hit with a £30,000 charge if they require treatment for decompression sickness, the government has confirmed.","Commercial divers in Guernsey will have to pay £250 a year to use a hyperbaric chamber, the health department has announced."

"Rajesh Shah, one of the shop's co-owners, told the BBC there would be a new name ""tomorrow or the day after"". Jews in the city of Ahmedabad, where the shop opened last month, said using the Nazi dictator's name was offensive. Israeli diplomats also raised the issue with the Gujarat state government. The owners said they did not know who Adolf Hitler was when the shop opened. Mr Shah told the BBC: ""Yes we are planning to change the name. There has been too much political pressure from the government."" He said officials had promised compensation for the rebranding of the store, which sells men's clothing, although he said they had provided nothing in writing. His co-owner, Manish Chandani, told AFP news agency they had never intended to glorify Hitler. ""I was not aware of Hitler being responsible for the killings of six million people before the shop's inauguration. This time I will choose a non-controversial name."" Mr Chandani says the shop's name was a tribute to his grandfather who was nicknamed Hitler because he was ""very strict"". Others saw the name as a marketing gimmick in a country where the former German leader attracts unusual interest in some sections of society.

"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. ""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months. Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say.","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed at least 120 civilians in and around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, activists say."

"The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period. The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%. However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%. The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%. ""The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services. Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes. Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June. Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter. Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter. Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year. The International Monetary Fund this week cut its forecast for US economic growth, in part citing uncertainty over the chances for tax reform and infrastructure spending, policies that many say could provide an economic boost.",The US economy grew at a faster pace than previously thought in the first three months of the year.,The US economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year.

Mr Haggarty has been waiting to discover if he will stand trial since signing an agreement to become an assisting offender under the terms of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) back in 2010.

An inquest into Mr Jones' death heard he had been a patient at the Hergest unit until a few days before his disappearance and continued to suffer anxiety and paranoia after he left hospital. He turned up at the unit in the early hours of 3 April and was sent to the accident and emergency department but left without booking in or speaking to anyone. Robat Hughes, the senior nurse who spoke to Mr Jones at the unit, told the inquest he regretted not asking him whether he was already having treatment. ""He came to the door and asked to see a doctor, but I said there was no doctor there as she'd gone home sick.  I said that if he went to accident and emergency then there were doctors there,"" he said. ""He was relaxed and calm.  I didn't know if he was using mental health services and I didn't ask.

"Wholesale prices have dropped and motoring organisations have suggested this merits reduced pump prices. Tesco and Morrisons are cutting prices by 2p a litre on Friday, and Asda and Sainsbury's said they would reduce prices by up to 2p a litre on Saturday. But drivers are being warned that prices can vary in different areas. The average UK price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 118.83p on Thursday, and 120.88p for a litre of diesel, according to the latest figures from Experian Catalist. Ten days earlier, the average unleaded price was 120p a litre, and diesel cost 122.06p. The oil price and wholesale prices fell sharply at the start of March, and motoring organisations have argued that this should have been feeding through to another 2p cut per litre in prices at the pumps. The RAC said motorists could feel ""aggrieved"" that prices had not fallen further, earlier. Asda said it had dropped prices twice in two weeks, and had a national price cap to ensure motorists were dealt with equitably. Morrisons said it had also made a second cut in two weeks.

Chairman Colin Smyth said: ""What we are now able to do is focus on what I think is the biggest issue as far as the public is concerned. In the draft proposal, the height of the embankment and the walls were simply too high and the public did not support that. ""What we now need to do is make sure that we find a solution that deals with the flooding, regenerates the Whitesands, solves the car parking issues, but also reduces the height of any proposed flood protection scheme."" Water from the River Nith regularly spills over into the Whitesands, flooding a major town centre car park and nearby business premises. Campaigners against the Â£15m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots.

David Slater, a local businessman who has been one of the project's most vocal objectors, said: ""However many other consultations they do now, public opinion will not change at this stage. ""It will be interesting to see how they can agree with the public to reduce the height of the bunds. There has to be better ideas because we can't put that in our town.""
